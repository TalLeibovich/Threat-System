# Threat Management System

A creative and unique software project for monitoring and managing citizens' threat levels during times of political instability.

---

## Project Overview

This system simulates the operation of an innovative threat management algorithm designed to decide which citizens should be sent to a "re-education" facility based on their dynamically calculated threat score. The project was developed as part of a Software Engineering course.

The **algorithm** that drives this project is fully original, creative, and built from scratch by our team. It manages a constantly updating environment, reflecting real-time changes in each citizen’s status and their eligibility for detention.

## Main Features

- **Dynamic Threat Calculation:**  
  Every citizen's threat level is calculated in real-time according to a variety of personal, economic, social, and political parameters.  
  The threat index is affected by:
    - Age
    - Ethnic group (majority/minority/other)
    - Economic percentile (1-10)
    - Level of support for the government (–10 to 10)
    - Public influence (social media followers, media mentions, etc.)
    - Parliament membership

- **Smart Detention Assignment:**  
  Citizens with a threat level above a certain threshold are selected for detention. The system adapts dynamically if facilities are full, replacing the least threatening detainees if needed.  
  Detention facilities are assigned based on current occupancy, always sending new detainees to the facility with the lowest rate.

- **Automatic and Event-Driven Updates:**  
  All threat calculations are updated immediately after every relevant change—no need for timed refreshes.

- **Full Role Separation:**  
  The system includes distinct roles: **Manager** (for managing citizens, facilities, and threat updates) and **President** (with special authority such as emergency detentions and pardons).

- **Historical Tracking:**  
  The relationship between citizens and facilities is logged, including entry and release dates, allowing for tracking of every citizen’s detention history.

- **Advanced Data Analysis:**  
  The system provides threat statistics for each facility and allows for future integration of machine learning and advanced analytics.

## Creativity and Uniqueness

This system is based on a **novel threat calculation algorithm**, fully designed by the team, introducing creative logic for dynamic, event-driven threat management and facility allocation.  
The combination of real-time updates, dynamic thresholding, and unique criteria for both threat and facility assignment creates a powerful simulation that goes far beyond a simple database project.

## Future Directions

Planned enhancements include:
- Predictive analytics using machine learning to forecast future threat levels.
- Geographic and demographic risk mapping.
- Integration of automated reporting and advanced visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Build and run the main file.
4. Log in as **Manager** or **President** to access the system’s menus.
